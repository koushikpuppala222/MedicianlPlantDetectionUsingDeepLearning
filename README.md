# MedicianlPlantDetectionUsingDeepLearning
In this project, our main aim is to create a Medicinal plant identification system using Deep Learning concept.  This project will classify the medicinal plant species with high accuracy. Identification and classification of  medicinal plants are essential for better treatment.
Identification of the correct medicinal plants that goes in to the preparation of a medicine is very important in ayurvedic, folk and herbal medicinal industry. The main features required to identify a medicinal plant is its leaf shape, colour and texture. Colour and texture from both sides of the leaf contain deterministic parameters to identify the species. A database of medicinal plant leaves is created from scanned images of front and back side of leaves of commonly used medicinal plants. The leaves are classified based on the shape and dimension combination. It is expected that for the automatic identification of medicinal plants this system will help the community people to develop their knowledge on medicinal plants, help taxonomists to develop more efficient species identification techniques and also participate significantly in the pharmaceutical drug manufacturing.
